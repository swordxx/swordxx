 *  swcom.h -    code for base class 'SWCom'.  SWCom is the basis for all
 *        types of commentary modules.
 *        It is traditionally close to the same as the SWText
 *        module type, but has defaults set which more
 *        closely represent how a commentary will be used and how
 *        the bulk of our commentaries expect to be used.  For example,
 *        most commentaries consist of entries for a range of text
 *        (Matt.1.1-6: "Matthew begins with by telling us...").  This
 *        same entry will be returned when any verse between Matt.1.1-6
 *        is requested from the engine.  This is done with verse linking.
 *        Since linking is used heavily in commentaries, the flag
 *        skipConsecutiveLinks is defaulted to true so when the
 *        commentary is incremented, it will go to the next ENTRY,
 *        not the next verse (likely Matt.1.7, from our example above).
