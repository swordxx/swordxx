Be sure to read INSTALL for information on how to get the software
built, configured, and running properly.

UNIX developers	You can try a './configure' (or optionally './usrinst.sh'
		for normal user configure options), then 'make' from this directory.
		This should compile everthing needed.  You may type
		'./configure --help' to see a list of options.
		If all compiles file, a 'make install' (as root, probably) will
		install libs to your system and you may begin using the library.
		There are a few basic tests (sword/tests), utilities
		(sword/utilities), examples (sword/examples/*) and very basic apps
		(sword/apps), in the tree.  The apps each have their own make system,
		so look for a ./configure or a README.

		./buildtest.cpp compiles to the executable 'buildtest' as a test to
		see if the libs have compiled and can be linked against successfully.
		This is NOT the final target of the build, nor does anything useful.

Other language bindings can be found in the ./bindings directory:
flatapi.cpp is a useful extern "C" interface for making bindings easier
Kylix bindings (and maybe Delphi bindings) may be found in sword/bindings/clx
CORBA (orbit-c++) bindings with Java example classes in /bindings/corba
SWIG stuff in bindings/swig
Perl stuff in bindings/perl

C++Builder developers	You may find project files and source for the WIN32
		frontend under apps/windows/CBuilder5/BibleCS

Delphi developers	You will need to place sword32.dll in your winsys
		directory or elsewhere in your path.  You can find source in
		./apps/windoze/bcowl25/swordapi
		or binary at: ftp://crosswire.org/pub/sword/attic/dlls.tar.gz
		This is an older build and probably should be regenerated.
		If you wish to add components to your toolbar, install
		./apps/windoze/delphi20/swordvc/swmodule.pas and
		./apps/windoze/delphi20/swordvc/swvskey.pas

Enjoy!
