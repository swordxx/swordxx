                       INSTALLATION NOTES


CONFIGURATION

You may want to have a look in the configuration file Makefile.cfg to be
sure everything is being built the way that you would like.


DECIPHER MECHANISM

Cipher tools are not included by default, so if you are planning on using
any copyrighted texts or any other ciphered modules, you will need to
add the necessary files before building.  SWORD uses the SAPPHIRE II cipher
which is not exportable in source form outside of the US and CANADA.  To
include encipher / decipher functionality, the necessary cipher package
MUST BE DOWNLOADED AND ADDED TO THE SOURCE TREE BEFORE COMPILING.
SAPPHIRE may be obtained from:

    http://cryptography.org/cgi-bin/crypto.cgi/libraries/sapphire.zip

These files must be replaced with files from this package:

    .../sword/include/sapphire.h
    .../sword/src/modules/common/sapphire.cpp

If you are outside of the US or Canada, you will have to obtain this package
elsewhere.


BUILDING

A 'make' at the top level directory of the SWORD package should build the
libraries necessary for building any of the frontends.  The libraries will
be built in the ./lib directory.  If you encounter an error, you may need
to change a setting in the Makefile.cfg file.  Most obviously watch for:
CC=gcc or CC=egcs

After the libraries are built, one then may proceed to the ./apps
directory.  The most basic application that is stable and easy to
build is the cheatah frontend (./apps/X11/cheatah).  These frontends
each have their own make system, so read the help in their respective
directories if a problem is encountered while building.


MODULES

To be useful the software needs to find SWORD 'modules' installed somewhere
accessible.  These module plugins consist of Bible texts, commentaries,
dictionaries, and the like.  New plugins are constantly being added.  They
may be obtained from:
http://www.crosswire.org or various mirrors.
A file named 'mods.conf' or directory named mods.d contains all configuration
information regarding the installed modules available to the API.  The format
of a config file is fairly straight-forward, and most modules come with their
own .conf file, of which the contents may be appended to the mods.conf file
or placed in the mods.d directory.

FOR A RECOMMENDED MODULE INSTALLATION SCHEME, SEE
.../sword/samples/recommended, otherwise, the specific details follow:

The API looks for its module configuration in the following sequence:
	./mods.[conf|d]
	$SWORD_PATH/mods.[conf|d]
	$HOME/.sword/mods.[conf|d]
	or finally from information found in a system-wide configuration file
		/etc/sword.conf in the format:
			[Install]
			DataPath=/where/your/datafiles/are/installed
		then the API will look for DataPath/mods.[conf|d]

* NOTE:
Using the above scheme, SWORD will also determine the path to prefix to the
specified datafile location found in the config files.  The prefix path will
be the directory where SWORD finds mods.[conf|d], WITH ONE EXCEPTION: if SWORD
finds its configuration in the user's home directory,
$HOME/.sword/mods.[conf|d], no prefix will be prepended to the data file
locations; hence, config files in $HOME/.sword must contain absolute path
names.

Sample config files can be found in: .../sword/samples
