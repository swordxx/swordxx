UNIX developers	You can try a make from this directory.  This should compile
		everthing needed.  You may need to edit Makefile.cfg to change,
		at least, CC=gcc or egcs.  If the src directory compiles, you
		have the libraries needed to develop, you may try any of the
		other directory independently thereafter (e.g. apps, examples).
		Remember to do a 'make clean; make'

		apps/X11 contains the makings of frontends

		./testlib.cpp compiles to the executable 'testlib' as a test to
		see if the libraries compiled and can be linked to successfully.
		This is NOT the final target of the build. :)


C++Builder developers	You may find project file and source for the WIN32
		frontend under apps/windows/CBuilder4/BibleCS


Delphi developers	You will need to place sword32.dll in your winsys
		directory or elsewhere in your path.  You can find source in
		./apps/windoze/bcowl25/swordapi
		or executable in ./bin (or from the homepage if it's not there.
		If you wish to add components to your toolbar, install
		./apps/windoze/delphi20/swordvc/swmodule.pas and
		./apps/windoze/delphi20/swordvc/swvskey.pas
