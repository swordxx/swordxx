A 'make' at the top level directory of the SWORD package should build the
libraries necessary for building any of the frontends.  The libraries will
be built in the ./lib directory.  If you encounter an error, you may need
to change a setting in the Makefile.cfg file.  Most obviously watch for:
CC=gcc or CC=egcs

After the libraries are built, one then may proceed to the ./apps
directory.  The most basic application that is stable and easy to
build is the cheatah frontend (./apps/X11/cheatah).  These frontends
each have their own make system, so read the help in their respective
directories if a problem is encountered while building.

To be useful the software needs to find SWORD 'modules' installed somewhere
accessible.  These module plugins consist of Bible texts, commentaries,
dictionaries, and the like.  New plugins are constantly being added.  They
may be obtained from:
http://www.crosswire.org or various mirrors.
A file named 'mods.conf' or directory named mods.d contains all configuration
information regarding the installed modules available to the API.  The format
of a config file is fairly straight-forward, and most modules come with their
own .conf file, of which the contents may be appended to the mods.conf file
or placed in the mods.d directory.

The API looks for its module configuration in the following sequence:
	./mods.[conf|d]
	$SWORD_PATH/mods.[conf|d]
	$HOME/.sword/mods.[conf|d]
	or finally from information found in a system-wide configuration file
		/etc/sword.conf in the format:
			[Install]
			DataPath=/where/your/datafiles/are/installed
		then the API will look for DataPath/mods.[conf|d]

* NOTE:
Using the above scheme, SWORD will also determine the path to prefix to the
specified datafile location found in the config files.  The prefix path will
be the directory where SWORD finds mods.[conf|d], WITH ONE EXCEPTION: if SWORD
find its configuration in the user's home directory
$HOME/.sword/mods.[conf|d], no prefix will be prepended to the data file
locations; hence, the config files must contain absolute path names.

Sample config files can be found in: .../sword/samples
